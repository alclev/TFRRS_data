# TFRRS Data Scraper for Lehigh University Track & Field

## Overview

Welcome to the TFRRS Data Scraper project for Lehigh University Track & Field! This Python program is designed to scrape raw data from [TFRRS.org](https://www.tfrrs.org) regarding track and field performance metrics of Lehigh University's track team. It then organizes this data by creating a folder hierarchy where each athlete has their own directory. The collected data is used to generate performance graphs over time for each athlete's events.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python and web scraping.

### Usage
To use the TFRRS Data Scraper, follow these steps:

Configure the scraper with the desired settings in config.py.

Run the scraper:
    ```shell 
    python3 <respective .py file>
The program will start scraping data from TFRRS.org and organize it in athlete-specific directories.

Once the scraping is complete, use the data for analysis or generate performance graphs using your preferred data visualization tools.

### Folder Hierarchy
Each athlete's data is stored in a separate directory under the data folder, with individual CSV files for each event they have participated in.
